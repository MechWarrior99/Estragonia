# Supported versions

Currently, Estragonia targets Avalonia 11.0.10 and Godot 4.2.2.  

Don't try to use Estragonia with unsupported Avalonia versions. In general, avoid referencing Avalonia directly when possible. Since Estragonia implements a backend for Avalonia, it targets some API that are semi-private and may change in future minor Avalonia releases. 

For Godot, you should be fine referencing the latest bug fix release, e.g. Godot 4.2.x. For major updates (e.g. Godot 4.3), you'll probably need to wait for a compatible Estragonia version to be released.

# Rendering

## Vulkan

Only the Vulkan renderers from Godot 4 are supported: these are the **Forward+** and **Mobile** renderers.  
The Compatibility renderer is NOT supported.

## Transparency

Estragonia leverages the Skia backend from Avalonia to render the controls, which outputs a texture having a premultiplied alpha channel.

By default, if no material is set on the `AvaloniaControl`, Estragonia automatically creates a `CanvasItemMaterial` with a [`BlendMode`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitemmaterial.html#enum-canvasitemmaterial-blendmode) sets to `PremultAlpha` so there's nothing special to do. If you need to set a custom material instead, ensure it has the correct blend mode, or semi-transparency won't work correctly.

## Scaling

To scale your UI, change the `RenderScaling` property of the `AvaloniaControl`.

## Texture access

If you need to access the texture containing the rendered Avalonia UI, for example to use it as a material's texture, call `AvaloniaControl.GetTexture()`. To make sure the texture is up-do-date, please read Godot's documentation for [Viewport.GetTexture](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_viewport.html#class-viewport-method-get-texture): the same constraints apply here. 

# Input

## Keyboard

To be able to use the keyboard inside Avalonia controls, make sure Godot's [`Control.FocusMode`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_control.html#class-control-property-focus-mode) property is set to `All`.  
To be able to input emojis and use the IME, call Godot's [`Window.SetImeActive(true)`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_window.html#class-window-method-set-ime-active) method.

## Controller

Game controller input from Godot are mapped to three Avalonia [routed events](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/concepts/input/routed-events) in the `JLeb.Estragonia.Input.JoypadEvents` class:
  - `JoypadButtonDownEvent` when a button is pressed
  - `JoypadButtonUpEvent` when a button is released
  - `JoypadAxisMovedEvent` when an axis (stick or trigger) moves

Use [`AddHandler`](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/concepts/input/routed-events#adding-and-implementing-an-event-handler-for-a-routed-event) to handle these events.

## Action mapping

By default, some Godot input actions are automatically mapped to an Avalonia `InputElement.KeyDownEvent`:

| Action      | Key          |
|-------------|--------------|
| `ui_left`   | `Key.Left`   |
| `ui_right`  | `Key.Right`  |
| `ui_up`     | `Key.Up`     |
| `ui_down`   | `Key.Down`   |
| `ui_accept` | `Key.Enter`  |
| `ui_cancel` | `Key.Escape` |

Implement proper keyboard handling and you should have controller UI support for free. Make sure the controller buttons are properly mapped to the built-in UI actions in Godot `Project ⇒ Project Settings ⇒ Input Map`.

This is the technique used in the [GameMenu sample](../samples/GameMenu).

If you prefer to disable this behavior and handle everything manually instead, set `AutoConvertUIActionToKeyDown` to `false` in the `AvaloniaControl`.
