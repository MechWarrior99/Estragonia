# Supported versions

Currently, Estragonia targets Avalonia 11.0 RC2 and Godot 4.1 RC2.  
Both these pre-releases are working pretty well and should have a stable release very soon, in July 2023.

Don't try to use Estragonia with unsupported Avalonia versions. In general, avoid referencing Avalonia directly when possible. Since Estragonia implements a backend for Avalonia, it targets some API that are semi-private and may change in future minor Avalonia releases. 

# Rendering

## Vulkan

Only the Vulkan renderers from Godot 4 are supported: these are the **Forward+** and **Mobile** renderers.  
The Compatibility renderer is NOT supported.

## Transparency

Estragonia leverages the Skia backend from Avalonia to render the controls, which outputs a texture having a premultiplied alpha channel.

By default, if no material is set on the `AvaloniaControl`, Estragonia automatically creates a `CanvasItemMaterial` with a [`BlendMode`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_canvasitemmaterial.html#enum-canvasitemmaterial-blendmode) sets to `PremultAlpha` so there's nothing special to do. If you need to set a custom material instead, ensure it has the correct blend mode, or semi-transparency won't work correctly.

## Scaling

To scale your UI, change the `RenderScaling` property of the `JLeb.Estragonia.AvaloniaControl`.


# Input

## Keyboard

To be able to use the keyboard inside Avalonia controls, make sure Godot's [`Control.FocusMode`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_control.html#class-control-property-focus-mode) property is set to `All`.  
To be able to input emojis and use the IME, call Godot's [`Window.SetImeActive(true)`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_window.html#class-window-method-set-ime-active) method.

## Controller

Game controller input from Godot are mapped to three Avalonia [routed events](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/concepts/input/routed-events) in the `JLeb.Estragonia.Input.JoypadEvents` class:
  - `JoypadButtonDownEvent` when a button is pressed
  - `JoypadButtonUpEvent` when a button is released
  - `JoypadAxisMovedEvent` when an axis (stick or trigger) moves

Use [`AddHandler`](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/concepts/input/routed-events#adding-and-implementing-an-event-handler-for-a-routed-event) to handle these events.

## Action mapping

By default, some Godot input actions are automatically mapped to an Avalonia `InputElement.KeyDownEvent`:

| Action      | Key          |
|-------------|--------------|
| `ui_left`   | `Key.Left`   |
| `ui_right`  | `Key.Right`  |
| `ui_up`     | `Key.Up`     |
| `ui_down`   | `Key.Down`   |
| `ui_accept` | `Key.Enter`  |
| `ui_cancel` | `Key.Escape` |

Implement proper keyboard handling and you should have controller UI support for free. Make sure the controller buttons are properly mapped to the built-in UI actions in Godot `Project ⇒ Project Settings ⇒ Input Map`.

This is the technique used in the [GameMenu sample](../samples/GameMenu).

If you prefer to disable this behavior and handle everything manually instead, set `AutoConvertUIActionToKeyDown` to `false` in the `JLeb.Estragonia.AvaloniaControl`.
